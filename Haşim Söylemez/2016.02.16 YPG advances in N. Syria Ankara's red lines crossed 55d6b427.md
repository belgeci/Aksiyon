  and claimed that the YPG had already advanced into territory west of the Euphrates. “Anyone who doesn't believe can come and see.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Turkey is helping [the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant] ISIL. Turkey is crossing the border [into Syria] at Jarabulus and allowing ISIL to breathe. Whoever helps the terrorists is a terrorist to us, and we will fight them,” he said, referring to Turkey. “By moving into the area west of the Euphrates, we have squeezed ISIL.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Turkish authorities previously warned the YPG not to go west of the Euphrates or risk facing a Turkish military response. If the political party affiliated with the YPG, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), establishes itself west of the river, Turkey is worried that the Syrian Kurdish PYD will be able to unite the cantons of Kobani, Jazira and Afrin and establish an unbroken Kurdish entity in northern Syria.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ankara fears that further expansion by the YPG will fuel separatist sentiment among its own Kurdish minority. It views the Syrian Kurdish PYD as a terrorist group because of its affiliation to Turkish Kurdish militants from the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
 </p>
 <p>
  For the US-led coalition, the PYD and its armed wing the YPG have recently emerged as a leading ground force in the fight against ISIL. Turkey has been critical of the US for supplying weapons and munitions to PYD forces in their fight against ISIL.
 </p>
 <p>
  The PYD was excluded from the first round of Syria peace talks held by the UN in

  on Friday. The PYD and its allies say their exclusion undermines the process and have blamed Turkey.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the report in Aksiyon published on Monday, Commander Simko, the YPG's regional point-man for the area including the Tishrin Dam, located on the Euphrates and which the YPG gained control of in late December 2015, said the dam was of immense importance due to its electricity production capability and because it was the “gate to Afrin.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “By taking this [Tishrin] dam, we [the YPG] have crossed west of the Euphrates and taken a historical step” Simko said. The Tishrin Dam has the capability to supply nearly all of the electricity for the Rojava region in northern Syria.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another of the commanders of the YPG base near the town of Qamishli in northern Syria by the name of Bozan was reported by Aksiyon to have said that the YPG units needed a few months to eliminate the ISIL threat in northern Syria, upon which their attention would turn to Turkey.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We need a few months. Then we [the YPG] will assist the YPS in Turkey,” he said. The Civil Defense Union (YPS) is a military unit established by the PKK and the PKK-affiliated Patriotic Revolutionist Youth Movement (YDG-H).
 </p>
 <p>
  “The coming of spring will be enough. Our job in Turkey will be hard but not impossible. Nothing will be the same again. The big resistance will begin in the spring,” Bozan was quoted as saying.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rojin Derik, the 23-year-old commander of the Women's Protection Units (YPJ) on the front line, told Aksiyon regarding Turkey's “red line”: “That's what [President Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan always says. … He has said that before. Now he's saying that we shouldn't go west of the Euphrates. We [the YPG] have died here. That is the biggest evidence that we were here.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “He [Erdoğan] sees Jarabulus as his own land. But Jarabulus is part of Rojava. These lands cannot be part of Turkey's ‘red line',” she said. “And even if they were, they no longer are.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “As you see, we are talking with you five kilometers west of the Euphrates. Ahead of us is ISIL. These are the facts,” she said.
